A cool, efficient, and easy-to-use Social Media App for communicating with friends.

# Authors : Vikrant Bhadauria, Anmol Raj Arora
â€¢ This repository consists of files required to deploy a ___Social Media Web App___ created with ___React.js___ and ___Firebase___ .

# Deliverables: 
* **Easy-To-Use:** We have made it painless to communicate with friends. Designed simple views for each page in our application, and we will regularly update and introduce just the best features when you need them. Easy-to-use views make your journey more cool, efficient to utilize, and comfortable to communicate.
* **Component-Based:** Built encapsulated components that manage their own state, then composed them to make easy-to-use UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, we can easily pass rich data through our app and keep state out of the DOM.
* **Create Once, Reuse Anywhere:** We take our rest of the technology stack seriously, so we can develop new features using React without rewriting existing code. We can also expand on the server-side using Node and power mobile app using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).
